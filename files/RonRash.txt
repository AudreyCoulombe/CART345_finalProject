Abandoned Homestead in Watauga County:
    All that once was is this,
    shattered glass, a rot
    of tin and wood, the hum
    of limp-legged wasps that ascend
    like mote swirls in the heatlight.
                                    
    Out front a cherry tree
    buckles in fruit, harvested
    by yellow jackets and starlings,
    the wind, the rain, and the sun.

Before:
    Before clock hands showed the time
    time ceased, and looking glasses
    were veiled as if they still held
    familiar faces, in those
    last moments when breath shallowed
    like a wellspring running dry,
    God-words quickened, only then
    the dying left death-beds borne
    on the arms of the gathered,
    lowered to the floor so they
    might press close, as though a door
    through which to listen and know
    the earth's old secrets before
    it opened, and they entered.
 
Eureka:
    Here was no place for illumination
    the cotton dust thick window-strained light.
    The metal squall drowned what could not be shouted
    everything geared warping and filling.
    
    Though surely there were some times that he paused
    my grandfather thinking This is my life
    and catching himself before he was caught
    lost wages or fingers the risk of reflection.
    
    Or another recalled in those reckoning moments
    remembering the mountains the hardscrabble farm
    where a workday as long bought no guarantee
    of money come fall full bellies in winter.
    
    To earn extra pay each spring he would climb
    the mill's water tower repaint the one word.
    That vowel heavy word defined the horizon
    a word my grandfather could not even read.

Speckled Trout:
    Water-flesh gleamed like mica:
    orange fins, red flankspots, a char
    shy as ginseng, found only
    in spring-flow gaps, the thin clear
    of faraway creeks no map
    could name. My cousin showed me
    those hidden places. I loved
    how we found them, the way we
    followed no trail, just stream-sound
    tangled in rhododendron,
    to where slow water opened
    a hole to slip a line in,
    and lift as from a well bright
    shadows of another world,
    held in my hand, their color
    already starting to fade.
