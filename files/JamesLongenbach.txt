Ice Men:
    One cuts blocks
    From the abundant river,
    Hauls them house to house.
    
    One falls, unseen,
    The heart
    Inoculated cold
    
    Against a sky still moving.
    Moving even now
    Above the river,
    The canal.
    Willows shimmering
    
    Across the water,
    Muskrats diving out of reach.
    The river whispers
    Till it freezes—
    
    A body
    Twirling sluggishly
    Beneath the surface as again
    
    One stack, then
    Spreads the straw.
    
    Another falters,
    Slips, or
    Puts a sliver on your tongue
    To feel it melting there—
    The ice-lit
    
    Underworld
    Of someone else.

Buried Life:
    Imagine cities you’ve
    Inhabited, streets
    Paved in lava stone.
    You never intended to pray
    
    In the temples, had
    Nothing to sell.
    Now imagine yourself
    
    Returning to those same cities.
    Hunt for people you knew,
    Knock on their doors.
    Ask yourself
    
    Where are the vases, animals
    Etched in gold?
    Where are the wines
    
    From distant places,
    Banquets ferreted
    From the bowels of the earth?
    While you were missing
    
    Other people wore
    Your garments,
    Slept in your bed.
    
    How frightening
    The man who said
    In his affliction
    
    Wood has hope.
    Cut down
    It will flourish.
    
    If the root grows old
    And the trunk withers
    In dust, at the scent of water
    It will germinate.

Second Life:
    Accompanied
    To the Campi Flegrei
    By a shadow,
    
    She listened to voices rise
    From the darkness,
    Then recede.
    
    Instruments
    Sustained them.
    When one had finished
    
    Others played.
    False proportions
    Sung boldly.
    
    Rain on the roof tiles.
    O selve, o campi.
