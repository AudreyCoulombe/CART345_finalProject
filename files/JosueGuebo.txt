"Again on this night like the previous at Lampedusa":
    Again on this night like the previous at Lampedusa
    a nondescript heart would open
    its hands to the disposable people
    In the scramble and howl of outrage
    its hands would be overloaded
    Ten centuries of brotherhood
    These hands sing Esperanto
    with the solemn tone of a requiem
    But the hands are nothing more than desire
    led astray across shipping lanes
    That heart's hands have received a mission
    to carry mankind's dreams across the open sea
    and here distracted by seasickness
    have become immobile

"O Eritrea I'd fill the horn":
    O Eritrea I'd fill the horn
    New signs to banish those spells that gore fate
    I'd punch the horn full of fraternal notes
    a harmony to deplete the archaic songs
    They are always of discord
    powdery rhythmics in which verse and chorus
    toss life into the pasture
    into the ground into the sand
    Only the sea can erase our boot prints in the clay
    or destroy the sandcastle
    Already determined by blood
    the earth has eaten its children
    The sea does not tell me
    what is has done
    stretching its tongue
    just a few lengths from Lampedusa

"The oil spill would advance":
    The oil spill would advance
    eating whole pieces of white bread
    Teeth rotten the spill swallows
    three-quarters of the bread
    and the crumbs loosen
    like a knot of intestine
    The tide would slide
    its slum water and seaweed
    across the water's white body
    Without a visa the blackened tide
    is not even recognized by the sky
    Convinced by the shushing waves
    that all will be saved
    the spill throws itself across the sea
    But the bread does not like the nibbling at its torso
    does not want its sides to be grazed like this
    The bread begins shouting out
    that it opposes such a race of teeth
    Blacks on this tide have a laugh
    are fed up with being fed to the sea
    have a laugh as lines disappear from the rainbow
    laugh at the puddle of drool on the white body
    of the white bread
